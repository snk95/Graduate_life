# About_Me:  
I am Sarvesh Kulkarni, studying computer science from Santa Clara University. I did my undergrad from Mumbai University in computer science where I was introduced to concepts of data structures in C programming, micro services, Java, SQL. In my final year project, I developed an android app to automate the in-lecture attendance system. After that I joined Atos Global IT Solutions where I was introduced to concepts of Hadoop and Big data. I worked on Informatica tool to develop structural flow of data. I also worked on Unix shell scripts to automate the workflow. The clients for which I was working were mainly from US and Netherlands. I received an award from Service Delivery Manager for my performance in the airline sector. This quarter, I have been introduced to concepts of micro services and kafka. I have written a research paper on semantic web and data integration as a part of project in this quarter. I have also developed my portfolio website in React.  I believe I am constantly in the learning phase where I am introducing myself to new things.
